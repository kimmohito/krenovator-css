If you already know HTML, this will be the next step for you. I will not be covering all the property or option that CSS has to offer because there are hundreds, but i will be covering all the concepts you need to know in order to get started with CSS. Let's first get started what CSS is...



## What is CSS ?
- Not a Programming Language
- Syling Language
- Used for Presentation
- Creatiivty Focused

The common misconseption, is that CSS is a programming language, but is incorrect. CSS is actually a styling language which is used for modifying the apperance of the the content of web pages. Just as HTML is used for the content of web pages, CSS is used for presentation of that content. Due to the fact that css is used for presentation and design. There are many ways to do the same thing. HTML on the other hand has set elements for most things which means that there is usually only one correct way to do things in HTML. The ability to do things in many different ways is the reason most people either love or hate CSS. I personally love it, since it lets you express your creativity and gives you freedom to do things how you want. Now we understand what CSS is, let's dive into tje details of how to use CSS. First, we need to discuss the syntax of CSS.

## CSS Syntax


```css
selector {
    property-1: value-1;
    property-2: value-2;
}
```
